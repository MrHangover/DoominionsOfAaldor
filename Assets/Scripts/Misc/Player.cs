//<Summary>
//The player class is used for all creatures that can be controlled by the user.
//This script forces all extensions of this class to implement 5 abilites and their functionality.
//It also contains movement control and some cooldown variables for use by scripts that extends this script.
//This script exends the creature script, and has all its functionalities.
